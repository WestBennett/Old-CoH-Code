<div>As I'm typing this, my team, <a href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/county-cricket-2012/engine/current/match/542547.html" target="_blank">Warwickshire County Cricket Club</a> - aka The Bears - are about to win the most prestigious award of the Season, the County Championship. They're doing that with a game in hand and are just a single wicket away.<br />
<br />
They're also in the CB40 Final to be played next week, so there's every chance they will do &quot;th
59d
e double.&quot;<br />
<br />
That probably doesn't mean too much to many of you - what with cricket being a minority sport and all ;) - but it's not as popular in North America as it used to be and will be again soon if rumours are to be believed. <br />
<br />
But we've just won as I type - with a day of this game to play! <br />
<br />
I'd trade it all if I could. I'd trade the Championship, the CB40 and T20 for the next five years to see City of Heroes survive. <br />
<br />
Of course that's a fallacious desire - it's not my choice to trade - but it does give a measure of how much City of Heroes means to me. I'm passionate about cricket - I was hoping we'd get a cricket bat for Titan Weapons and Mace - but I guess that's never going to be now. <br />
<br />
The battle cry of Warwickshire is &quot;Come on You Bears!&quot;<br />
<br />
Maybe it should be &quot;Come On You Heroes!!&quot;</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: postbit_external -->
<div>I know at this point we all feel like NCSoft just shot our dog, heck even I do, but I would like to keep this thread flame free and constructive. The truth is, there were 2 ways this could have gone down: either NCSoft turned off CoH, or NCSoft itself shut down. Either the case we would loose CoH.<br />
 <br />
With all the information that has been put out there,
5a8
 either on these forums, facebook or other website interviews, it seems the possible reason CoH is getting shut down is because CoH was not as profitable as NCSoft needed it to be. I'm creating this thread as a brainstorming for possible options to increase the profitability of CoH. <br />
 <br />
I know, you might be thinking what power do we have over that? More than you think actually! You have to realise that WE are the source of their case flow. However, NCSoft might not have been willing to try certain options out of fear of scaring off clients. I'm hoping they will read this thread, and see what we, as their customer, are willing to do.<br />
 <br />
<b><font color="red">NEW ACCOUNT CONFIGURATION</font></b><br />
<br />
<font color="white">Alot of people on Facebook and on these forums are suggesting that they increase the cost of subscriptions. Heck, even I would pay an extra 5-10$ a month if it meant it would save this game! </font><br />
 <br />
However, this option could also alienate other players, who can't afford to pay more per month. So by doing this they could end up loosing subs, and scaring off potential new customers. <br />
 <br />
Here's what I suggest: add a new account type.<br />
 <br />
Currently we have (to my knowledge, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong) Free, Premium and VIP. What I'm suggesting would be something like Free, Premium, VIP and Gold. All current account types would be there, so p
5a8
layers would not loose the options they already have. The new account type would cost more to allow NCSoft to charge more money and allow the players who do have the extra cash to choose this option. As for what the different benefits this new gold account would have, I'll leave that up to others to speculate. But the ideas are out there, like maybe a freeform character perserver for that account, Or personal nemesis.<br />
 <br />
<b><font color="red">IN GAME ADDS</font></b><br />
<br />
<font color="white">Adding in game advertisement is something that was mentioned in the past. I don't know why it was not implemented, or if it was and it just flopped, but maybe this needs to be revisited. Maybe reduce the cost for in game adds? a little money is better than no money, right? Or NCSoft can use it for free advertising of their other games.</font><br />
 <br />
I remember the community being up in arms and saying it would break game immersion, that they didnt want to pay for this game if reall world advertisements were going to be included, etc,etc,etc. At this point, I'm sure people would rather have in game adds breaking immersion than not having immersion period!<br />
 <br />
<b><font color="red">REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF SERVERS</font></b><br />
<br />
<font color="black"><font color="white">The monetary impact of this would be minimal, but 2 fold.</font> </font><br />
 <br />
First, having/maintaining a server costs money. I
5a8
t consumes electricity, it needs hardware, it needs room, etc. Currently we have 16 servers. If we reduce the number of servers to 8, we would ideally be reducing the cost of running these by half.<br />
 <br />
Second, community would be modified. In the past, merging servers was a great debate; some people wanted it, others didnt. Again, at this point, I believe we would agree to merge servers, over not having servers to log on to, period. Tho an increase in numbers/players on every server would defenetly look more appealing to new players, so this might help attract new customers.<br />
 <br />
<b><font color="red">PAY FOR CONTENT</font></b><br />
<br />
<font color="white">CoH is known for adding new and free content. Over the years they added 23 free issues, which were awesome and we love you guys for doing so. But now I believe that it's time to have us pay for it, because paid for content is better than no content at all.</font><br />
 <br />
What I would suggest is a model similar to DCUO, when they have download packs of content, and that must be paid for. This would allow people to keep playing the game, even if they pay for the content or not. It would work like CoV did; you buy it, you have access to it, you don't, you can't acces it but can still play CoH.<br />
 <br />
This is all that I had off the top of my head. Feel free to add more ideas.</div>

<div>There's <a href="http://kotaku.com/5940672/pissed-off-employees-bash-pretty-much-every-major-video-game-company" target="_blank">an interesting article</a> at Kotaku which collect from Glassdoor employee opinions on gaming companies. Here's what NCsoft gets:<br />
<br />
<b>NCSoft</b><br />
<br />
 <a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-NCsoft-EI_IE23242.11,17.htm" target="_blank"><b>Company Overview</b></a><br />
 Average Rating: 2.5 (&quot;Dissatisfied&quot;)<br />
 25% approve of CEO Kim Tack-Jin<br />
 &quot;<a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-NCsoft-RVW846183.htm" target="_blank">Terrible environment, unorganized, lack of leadership and absolutely no support</a>,&quot; written by a former employee on March 9, 2011.<br />
 <font color="black">&quot;I could not wish this company to my enemy.&quot;</font><blockquote> Cons  � There is not enough words to explain how terrible this place is.  There were people who would last one day, on average employees would  leave every 3 months, just enough time to realize how messed-up the  company was. No leadership, complete chaos caused by the HQ and the lack
5a8
  of professionalism in the Seattle office. I could not wish this company  to my enemy. The joke at the end of every week was how many emails we  would get from HR informing us that people were leaving (though usually,  [NCSoft executives request] HR send an email 3-4 weeks after the  employees had left). The exec. team tries to hide everything. Employees  are treated like idiots. No support, no recognition, no raise.<br />
<br />
</blockquote>Edit: Just got to SOE where &quot;19% approve of President John Smedley&quot;. So it could be worse. :)</div>

<div>tl;dr - Reply to this thread with an item that can be bought with Astral or Reward merits and I'll give it to you.  Make sure you include your ingame @global so I know where to sent it!<br />
<br />
LotG 7.5% or anything else, as long as you can receive it in an email.  Enjoy!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
One last time I would like to give something back to the community who's given me some of the best years of my life.<br />
<br />
There is a treasure of merits on my account that I would like to give you.  Since I can't email them directly, I will use them to buy whatever one tradable item you want that can be purchased via the Merit Vendors.  (ie Please don't ask for an Unlock Alpha Slot Voucher, I can't give it to you.)<br />
<br />
There are 250+ Astral Merits and 10,000+ Reward Merits to spend!  Offer is open until the merits are gone.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://paragonwiki.com/wiki/Incarnate_Merit_Vendor#Instant_Purchases" target="_blank">Astral Merit Vendor</a><br />
<a href="http://paragonwiki.com/wiki/Reward_Merit_Vendor#Rewards_Purchases" target="_blank">Reward Merit Vendor</a><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Remember to:<br />
<br />
1) Reply to this thread with what <b>one</b> item you would like from an Astral Merit Vendor or Reward Merit Vendor.<br />
<br />
2) Include your in-game @global name so I know where to send it.  Limit one request per @global.<br />
<br />
You can <a href="private.php?do=newpm&amp;u=355986" target="_blank">PM me</a> your @global if you would prefer, but please still reply here in this thread with what you would like from the Merit Vendor.<br />
<br />
3) Enjoy!  I will email you your gift within two days.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Let the gifting begin!</div>

<div>Hi all,<br />
<br />
Sorry for the late notice of this, but I'd rather not wait much longer on these.<br />
<br />
Tomorrow night (Thursday, Sept 6th), sometime after 6pm EST, I'll be gathering people who are interested in getting the Master's of Magisterium Badges.  Thursday will mostly be a practice session to get us used to avoiding Tyrant's lightning consistently.  We won't be using Ultimates for the practice, but it is really important that you be there to get in shape for the real deal.<br />
<br />
Friday, we'll prep as if we are doing the MO. We'll do one test and then see if we can go for it.  If not, we'll keep practicing.  We'll start Friday at 7:30pm EST.<br />
<br />
Saturday, we'll start up at 2:00pm EST. To mix things up and get people some astrals to use for Ultimates, we'll run a MoUG to start up. (I promised a certain someone I'd run one... and dammit, they're not going to make a liar out of me!) Hopefully we can get that done in 1 shot. 2 at the most. Then we start up with MoMagi stuff again.<br />
<br />
I'm open to ideas on this and I apologize for the lack of organization on this.  I was just guaging interest in this and there's enough for me to give it a good shot for you guys.<br />
<br />
We'll be using vent again. I think that'll work best.<br />
<br />
I'll take care of more of this tomorrow when I'm online again.  If you see people that will be serious about doing this and would be interested, please let them know.<br />
<br />
Heroes don't die. Their legends live forever.<br />
